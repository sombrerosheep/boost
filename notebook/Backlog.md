- [x] Randomly spawn obstacles based on time #todo #gameplay @completed(2023-04-29T16:05:51)
    - use a single obstacles system with multiple timers
    - Different rates
        - Rocks (frequent)
        - Space Junk (frequent)
        - Rockets (rare)
        - Satellites (seldom)
        - Nukes (very rare)
- [ ] Spawn obstacles by chance not timers #todo #gameplay 
    - single cooldown timer (500ms?)
    - get a random number and spawn an entity
    - How and when to spawn?
        - evaluate from least to most likely?
        - spawn any number that qualify?
    - 0..100
        - Space Junk (<80)
        - Rocks (<70)
        - Satellites (<60)
        - Rockets (<40)
        - Nukes (<20)
- [ ] Nukes Destroy obstacles within radius #todo #gameplay 
- [ ] Collisions between obstacles and player I #todo #gameplay #collisions
    - reduces player health by a bit

    - objects velocity impacts damage taken

- [x] Background I #todo #art #gameplay @completed(2023-04-25T21:33:46)
    - something to indicate movement
    - randomly spawn stars
    - cleanup as they fall off
- [ ] Background II #todo #art #gameplay
    - On start, visible horizon that fades after a bit
- [ ] Background III #todo #art #gameplay
    - slowly fades from blue (earth) to black as you move
    - Should earth look more destructive and on fire?
- [ ] Background IV #todo #art #gameplay
    - stars fade in after a bit 
    - they'll become more visible as you leave earth
- [ ] Sound FX #todo #sound #fx
    - rocket thruster
    - rock on rock collision (rock on rock)

- [x] subtle velocity for rocks #todo #gameplay  @completed(2023-04-29T21:20:43)
    - always in -y (`+/-x`)
- [x] sublte rotation for rocks #todo #gameplay  @completed(2023-04-29T16:54:41)
- [x] obstacle controller #todo #gameplay  @completed(2023-04-28T03:40:43)
    - spawn obstacles at different rates
    - responsible for despawning off-camera
    - each type should still have its own despawn system
- [ ] trajectory for inactive nukes #todo #gameplay 
    - less than subtle velocity.
    - these are sort of floating around, out of orbit and off trajectory
- [ ] trajectory archs for active nukes #todo #gameplay 
    - we encounter them as they're en-route
- [ ] AI for rockets #todo #gameplay 
    - some level of navigation ignoring all obstacles that are not the player
- [ ] Rendering layer by camera #todo #architecture
    - Add camera render layers  
    - This doesn't actually dictate render order like I thought. To do that you'd need multiple cameras which can be done in an order. Each camera would then be assigned to layer(s)
    - alternative for draw order is using z corrdinates and maintaining the magic numbers for each types z-coordinate
    - See https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1275
    - https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/features/camera.html#render-layers
    - stars
    - player/obstacles
        - should these be together? #question
- [x] Rendering layers: z-ordering #todo #gameplay  @completed(2023-04-29T16:05:44)
	- quick solution without over complicating rendering layers + multiple cameras until I unerstand them better
- [x] Implement fuel #todo #gameplay @completed(2023-05-01T03:38:50)
    - consumed at a slow rate
    - movement consumes slightly more
